    <h1>Improving Onion Shelf Life â€“ A Transdisciplinary Approach</h1>

    <p>India with a population of 1.35 billion is the second largest producer of onion in the world (~25 Million MT in 2021). Over 70% of the onions are grown in the western and southern parts of the country. This imbalance in supply chain along with the high perishability of onions make the value chain inefficient.</p>

    <p>For the year-round consumption, onion is stored in traditional open ventilated storage structures where reported storage losses are in the range between 40 to 60%. The government is investing a large sum of money to stabilize the market prices through the construction of large sized open storage structures. But, due to huge losses in traditional open structures, there is urgent need of affordable as well as scientific solution to this complex problem. With our research group at IIT Bombay, India, we addressed this issue by developing a storage technology with a transdisciplinary approach and came to very promising results.</p>

    <h2>What affects the shelf life of onions during the storage period?</h2>

    <p>Summer onions are harvested in the month of April, making up more than 60% of the total onion production. They are considered a good variety for storage compared to the winter and late winter season onions. Indian weather is driven by its monsoon cycle. Summer onions arrive for storage in the month of April and rain starts in June. So, weather changes rapidly in month of June and stored onions have to face high humidity as well as low temperature conditions. These conditions trigger the creation and propagation of bacteria and fungus in the onion which leads onions further towards rotting.</p>

    <p>Moreover, it results in sprouting of the onion which makes it further vulnerable to disease attack and additional water loss. Along with the above-mentioned weather conditions, other reasons for the reduced shelf life are poor ventilation at the storage facilities. Due to heavy staking of onions in storage containers and poor ventilation, mechanical damage occurs. The gases emitted by onions during storage canâ€™t escape and further accelerate the process of onion deterioration.</p>

    </figure>

    <h2>Transdisciplinary Nature of the Problem</h2>

    <p>A major fraction of onion farmers are small holder farmers holding less than 1 hectare of land. The onion, being a cash crop, is a major source of cash flow for their families. Market fluctuations in prices directly affect their livelihood. On the other side, a significant fraction of retail buyers are low income households. Increased prices of onions due to shortages directly affect their food budget.</p>

    <p>Improving the shelf life of onions needs innovative approaches that are technological, affordable, accessible and appropriate. It involves science, technology, navigating power relations among stakeholders and understanding policies for driving decisions along the onion value chain. Therefore, solving the problem of post-harvest loss of onions calls for a transdisciplinary approach.</p>

    <h2>Climate Agnostic Onion Storage Structure at CTARA, IIT Bombay</h2>

    <p>Research has shown that onion can be stored with minimum storage losses at controlled conditions near ambient conditions with a specified combination of temperature, humidity, air flow rate and other factors. Cold storages near zero temperature do not work with Indian conditions for many reasons. One reason is the high ambient temperatures and the subsequent higher cooling costs.</p>

    <p>At CTARA-IIT Bombay, we developed a storage structure which keeps onion quality intact irrespective of the outside climatic conditions (hence called â€˜Climate Agnosticâ€™). It circulates the conditioned air inside the storage enclosure to keep the inside conditions at specified levels. This reduces unwanted weight loss of onion, sprouting and rotting.</p>

    <h2>How End Users' Feedback Improves Technology</h2>

    <p>Talking to the end users (farmers in this case) gave us insights into choosing the right problems! After the proof of concept stage, when we presented our storage technology to farmers, many of their queries and suggestions made us rethink and modify the design. For example, some farmers suggested having an alternate source of electricity to reduce the dependence on uncertain on-grid electricity in rural India.</p>

    <p>The farmersâ€™ suggestions played a key role in our technology generation because there are several aspects which technology alone cannot solve. One needs to think of the entire ecosystem and all the stakeholders involved.</p>

    </figure>

    <p>If a technologically appropriate solution is not affordable to the end users, then it is still inaccessible! Hence, one major focus laid on optimising our solution for trade-offs between investment versus returns and reduced losses versus realised profits.</p>

    <h2>The Journey Continues...</h2>

    <p>The journey of improving the shelf life of onions through Climate Agnostic Storage structures has now evolved to a â€˜transdisciplinary co-creation of the technologyâ€™ from a mere â€˜engineering problemâ€™. Increasing engagement of stakeholders and their continuous feedback helps us improve the technology every single day.</p>
