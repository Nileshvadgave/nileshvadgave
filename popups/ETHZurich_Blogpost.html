    <h1>Who Moved My Onion?</h1>

    <h2>What’s wrong with onions in India?</h2>
    <p>India, with its 1.35 billion population, is the second largest producer of onion in the world (25 million MT in 2021). When it comes to consumption, India with its cultural diversity and varying food habits across the country consumes a huge amount of onion throughout the year. Major portion of onion (>70%) is cultivated in four major states located in the western and southern parts of the country. This skewed distribution of production and its high perishability has made the onion value chain inefficient.</p>

    <h2>A Lose-Lose Game for Smallholder Farmers?</h2>
    <p>Most farmers in India are smallholders. Onion being a major cash crop, is always a hope for farmers for their regular monetary needs (child education and health spending).</p>

    <p>During the field survey with onion growers and Farmer Producer Organisations, following major reasons were identified which affect the resilience and efficiency of the onion value chain:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Lack of access to good quality onion seed</li>
      <li>Poor penetration of knowledge on appropriate farming practices</li>
      <li>Improper irrigation and fertigation</li>
      <li>Improper neck cutting, curing, storage and transport</li>
      <li>Heavy and uncertain rain (effects of climate change)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Uncertainties in Profit Margins due to Market Dynamics</h2>
    <p>Onion is cultivated in Rabi, Kharif and late Kharif seasons in India. Market heavily relies on Rabi onion (60% of total production) that arrives in April. Due to poor storage infrastructure and high perishability, farmers tend to bring them to market right after harvesting. This oversupply results in a huge drop in onion price and farmers face significant loss.</p>

    <h2>Poor and Unscientific Storage Infrastructure</h2>
    <p>Storage plays a pivotal role in the onion value chain. Government reports say that only 0.4 million MT of storage infrastructure is available in India where the need is at least 10 million MT. Through various studies, 40–50% of harvested onion gets wasted before reaching the platter. Storage losses take the major portion of this pie, mainly due to physiological weight loss (PWL), sprouting and rotting.</p>

    <h2>Is Cold Storage an Option?</h2>
    <p>As the storage requirement of onion in Indian geographic and climatic conditions are different, cold storages do not prove to be an alternative to the traditional storage structure on economic and technical grounds. Storing at near zero temperatures creates problems of high energy consumption and sprouting when brought back to ambient conditions.</p>

    <h2>Climate Agnostic Onion Storage Structures — A Way Out?</h2>
    <p>Research has shown that there are “sweet spots” near ambient atmospheric conditions (for India) where onion can be preserved and saved from the above-mentioned storage losses. These storage structures are called <strong>Climate Agnostic Storage Structures</strong>. They can improve shelf life while being energy efficient, and can also integrate curing and storage operations to prevent rotting.</p>

    <h2>Economy of Scale and Hope for Farmers</h2>
    <p>Climate agnostic structures consume energy but minimize storage losses. Studies from IIT Bombay show that building such storage structures above 300 MT capacity gives significant benefits to farmers compared to traditional storage. Groups of 20 or more farmers can collectively own and operate such storage structures under different business models.</p>

    <h2>Way Ahead</h2>
    <p>Further investigation is being done on optimising the energy use, GHG emissions prevented, using solar-powered systems for rural areas, and improving the affordability and adaptability of such storage systems to strengthen rural economy and improve farmers’ gains.</p>
